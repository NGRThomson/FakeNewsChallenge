# FakeNewsChallenge

This repo contains code for the Fake News Challenge on Stance Detection.

It is built mostly in Numpy and Pandas, with a final couple of models in XGBoost and Keras. The following areas are covered:

* Data preparation done by hand
* TFIDF and NGrams coded and visualised in Seaborn
* Cosine, Manhatten, Jaccard Distances calculated for body, headline pairs by hand
* KL Divergence calculated for each pair
* Linear and Logistic regression in Numpy
* XGBoost and Keras used for further models
* Use of Bayesian Optimisation using HyperOpt
